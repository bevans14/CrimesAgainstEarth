# Crimes Against Earth

Crimes Against Earth brings real-time information on air quality and carbon emissions. Utilizing API's, we create different functionalities to the user that allow them to get accurate data for what they are lookin for. Our application allows users to look-up the air quality of cities, take quizzes, explore articles based on Carbon Emission and Air Quality, and utilize a map GUI to explore the air quality of the world.
