                    <h2>WHAT</h2>
                    <p>What are carbon emissions? Carbon emissions are sources of emissions that produce harmful gas such as CO2 (Carbon Dioxide), CH4 (Methane), and N2O (Nitrous Oxide). Some major contributors of these poluttants include burning of fossil fuels, transportation, manure, and deforestation.</p>

                    <h2>WHY</h2>
                    <p>Why are we talking about it? Carbon emissions are on the rise once more, especially in effort to rebuild after economic shutdown due to the recent Covid-19 Pandemic. If we were to continue our emissions, we would exceed 1.5 degree Celcius pre-industrial era. This would lead to fatal heat, catastrophic floods, and rise in global temperatures. These are just a few effects if we were to continue our carbon emissions.</p>

                    <h2>HOW</h2>
                    <p>How can you help? There are many ways to assist in slowing down our carbon emissions, it just takes the first step. You can use our calculator to see how big your carbon footprint is and see ways that maybe you can prevent additional carbon emission. More simple acts such as walking/biking to close destinations can also be your effort in reducing carbon emissions.</p>
